<!--
Input Interface:- Using HTML, CSS, create a decent input interface with proper labels and input boxes for a person to fill in his/her/their personal details.
Those details should correspond to the fields in students.json, i.e. the person’s “IITB Roll Number”, “Name”, “Year of Study”, “Age”, “Gender”,  “Interests”, “Hobbies”, “Email” and “Photo”.
For “Gender”, create a set of radio buttons to choose a single option.
For “Interests” and “Hobbies”, create a set of checkboxes to choose multiple options for each.
There should be some sort of a “Submit” button which on clicking should “find” the person’s “right match”.
Do this work in files named “dating.html” and “style.css”. You can assume that the person will always give valid non-empty responses.
