    When the person clicks “Submit”, a new tab will appear showing the “right match” for that person along with their details (if you succeed in finding the “right match” for that person). 
    The structure for this interface will be done in a separate .html file named “match.html”, but the same CSS and Javascript files will be used, i.e. style.css and script.js
